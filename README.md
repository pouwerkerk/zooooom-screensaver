# Zooooom Screensaver
_A screensaver for these anxious times_

You can build & install this locally, but you'll need an Apple developer account setup to notarize the build if you want to share with others.

For debugging, I recommend using the preview app, as it's much easier to troubleshoot.

To install the screensaver:
1. Build the `Screensaver` scheme.
1. Under `Products` in the file organizer on the left, right-click your screensaver and select `Open with External Editor`.
1. Follow the prompts.

Pro tip: you may want to close System Preferences between installs to ensure you're getting the latest. Occasionally, you may have to delete the last build to get the latest.
